# Face Classification based on Unknown Criteria

This repository comprises my solution to a datachallenge organised at Telecom Paris at the end of an Advanced Machine Learning course. It contains :
* A [jupyter notebook](./Face_Classification_Unk.ipynb) detailing my classification algorithm and the choices taken to develop it (used as a report)
* [Python scripts](./scripts) used for training the best model, classifying the images and generating the attention maps
* A [presentation](./Restitution_Datachallenge.pdf) of the approach in PDF format, used to explain my reasoning to the whole promotion at the end of the challenge
* The [images](./data_challenge_Avril_2023) used as dataset for the challenge
